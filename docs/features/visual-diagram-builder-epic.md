# Epic: Visual Diagram Builder with Drag-and-Drop Canvas

## Overview
Transform the diagram creation experience by providing a professional drag-and-drop visual editor. Users can drag shapes from a categorized toolbox onto a canvas, connect them visually, and have the application automatically generate the corresponding Mermaid syntax. This eliminates the need to learn Mermaid syntax for basic diagram creation while maintaining the power of code-based editing for advanced users.

## Current State Analysis
The application currently has a **fully functional visual diagram builder** that:
- ✅ Three-panel layout with toolbox, canvas, and properties
- ✅ Drag-and-drop shapes from toolbox to canvas
- ✅ Visual node manipulation (select, move, resize with 8-point handles)
- ✅ Multi-select support (Ctrl+Click and rubber-band selection)
- ✅ Visual connection drawing with connection points
- ✅ Connection endpoint reconnection support
- ✅ Comprehensive edge properties panel (anchors, line style, arrows)
- ✅ Properties panel for editing node and connector properties with automatic updates
- ✅ Real-time Mermaid code generation from canvas
- ✅ Grid display and snap-to-grid functionality
- ✅ Zoom controls (zoom in/out/reset)
- ✅ Delete key support for nodes and connectors (single and multi-select)
- ✅ Canvas metadata stored as Mermaid comments
- ✅ Double-click inline editing for node labels with auto-close on click elsewhere
- ✅ Double-click inline editing for edge labels with proper positioning
- ✅ Edge labels display at midpoint and follow edges when nodes move
- ✅ Edge labels properly cleaned up when edges deleted
- ✅ Consistent selection/deselection behavior (edges deselect when clicking nodes)
- ❌ Code-to-canvas parsing not yet implemented (Story 8)
- ❌ Undo/redo system not implemented (Story 10)
- ❌ Context menus and full keyboard shortcuts missing (Story 13)
- ❌ Alignment and distribution tools missing (Story 11)
- ❌ Diagram type switcher UI missing (Story 12)
- ❌ Custom file format not implemented (Story 17)

**Key Achievement:** The visual builder is now **production-ready** for creating flowchart diagrams visually, with automatic Mermaid code generation, comprehensive inline editing, robust multi-select with rubber-band selection, and polished UX. The main remaining gap is bidirectional sync (parsing code back to canvas).
